                    Custom Enclosures Western Control Systems and Krage
                    Manufacturing pride ourselves on designing specialty and
                    customized enclosures that serve the varying needs of our
                    customers. We can take your rough sketch, picture or CAD
                    drawing and fabricate an enclosure to fill your needs.
                    Frequently, we match existing enclosures in the field to
                    insure your control room looks professional. Why purchase a
                    standard run-of-the-mill enclosure and manually layout your
                    cut-outs and hole patterns when you can get a completed
                    enclosure from Western Control Systems and Krage
                    Manufacturing with all your requirements built in. Krage
                    Manufacturing fabricates thousands of enclosures each year
                    for OEM’s, utilities, electrical contractors and other
                    specialty markets. We are UL listed for Type 1, 3R, Nema 4,
                    Nema 4X and Nema 12 electrical enclosures. We work closely
                    with UL on new enclosure requirements and test new designs
                    in UL laboratories for those special needs. All our
                    enclosures are pretreated and powder coated to insure
                    excellent coating adhesion and corrosion protection for a
                    long service life.

                    Krage Mfg. has a complete powder coating and painting
                    operation. Skilled coaters operate Nordson powder guns in
                    multiple booths. A three stage phosphate pretreatment system
                    insures excellent coating adhesion and corrosion protection.
                    Salt spray tests exceed 1,000 hours for several powder
                    applications. Multiple ovens are employed with capacities of
                    10’H x 10’W x 16′ or more in length. Liquid painting
                    operations use the same pretreatment method as powder
                    coating. A conveyor system provides an efficient part flow
                    from pretreatment through paint and into part drying. Media
                    blasting is used for previously coated parts or to remove
                    mill scale. The blast booth can handle large frames up to
                    16′ long. Longer parts can be handled as well. All blasted
                    parts are pretreated with the 3 stage phosphate system to
                    again insure maximum coating adhesion and corrosion
                    protection.

                    Custom Enclosures Western Control Systems and Krage
                    Manufacturing pride ourselves on designing specialty and
                    customized enclosures that serve the varying needs of our
                    customers. We can take your rough sketch, picture or CAD
                    drawing and fabricate an enclosure to fill your needs.
                    Frequently, we match existing enclosures in the field to
                    insure your control room looks professional. Why purchase a
                    standard run-of-the-mill enclosure and manually layout your
                    cut-outs and hole patterns when you can get a completed
                    enclosure from Western Control Systems and Krage
                    Manufacturing with all your requirements built in. Krage
                    Manufacturing fabricates thousands of enclosures each year
                    for OEM’s, utilities, electrical contractors and other
                    specialty markets. We are UL listed for Type 1, 3R, Nema 4,
                    Nema 4X and Nema 12 electrical enclosures. We work closely
                    with UL on new enclosure requirements and test new designs
                    in UL laboratories for those special needs. All our
                    enclosures are pretreated and powder coated to insure
                    excellent coating adhesion and corrosion protection for a
                    long service life.
